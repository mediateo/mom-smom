        <p>I always thought my mom was born in Gimcheon.</p>
        <p>But in a single phone call, her information changed in an instant.</p>
        <p>A daughter born to my mom’s mom who came to Seoul.</p>
        <p>A magnolia tree gifted by my mom’s mom’s mom for them to grow up together.</p>
        <p>Memory, like teleportation, changes from one thing to another in an instant.</p>
        <p>my mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's</p>
        <p>my mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's</p>
        <p>my mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's</p>
        <p>my mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's</p>
        <p>my mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's mom's</p>
        <p>Memory is something that can become this or that in a moment through the language of the person remembering.</p>
        <p>Jumping through spaces involves feeling the distance and not losing the sense of movement,</p>
        <p>but involuntary teleportation is disorienting and nauseating.</p>
        <p>I lose my direction and position.</p>
        <p>Another line to fill the height properly.</p>
